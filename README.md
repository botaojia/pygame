# A space shooting game

Although this is a very naive game, I implemented it from scratch. All game graphics and sound effects are created/recorded by myself (a few of the them are modified using resources at https://opengameart.org/ etc.)

1. a windows executable (tested on Windows 7/10)

A Windows executable [download](https://github.com/botaojia/pygame/raw/pencilJet/pcc/pencilJet.zip) --- start to play by unzipping [pencilJet.zip](https://github.com/botaojia/pygame/blob/pencilJet/pcc/pencilJet.zip), and double clicking pencilJet.exe. The executable was wrapped up by pyinstaller which is not a standard package, thus game graphics may show different resolutions on different computers.

2. source code

All python source code, images, sound resources are in [pcc/source](https://github.com/botaojia/pygame/tree/pencilJet/pcc/source).
To run scripts, python and pygame need to be installed. Then execute [pencilJet.py](https://github.com/botaojia/pygame/blob/pencilJet/pcc/source/pencilJet.py).

3. how to play

The only input controls are mouse movement and left mouse button click.
ESC or closing game window to exit.
Highest score will always be displayed on top of the screen until exiting the game.
Highest score the I got was 6950.
