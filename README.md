# A space shooting game by Python+Pygame

Although this is a very naive game, I implemented it from scratch. All game graphics and sound effects are either created by myself, or modified using resources from https://opengameart.org/ etc.

1. source code

All python source code, images, sound resources are in the following folder pcc/source.
To run scripts, python and pygame need to be installed. Then execute pcc/source/pencilJet.py.

2. a windows executable

A Windows executable -- unzip pcc/pencilJet.zip, and run pencilJet.exe. The executable was wrapped up by pyinstaller, and tested on Windows 7. Because pyinstaller is not a standard package, the executable might show game graphics at different resolutions on different computers.

3. how to play

The only input controls are mouse movement and left mouse button click.
ESC or closing game window to exit.
Highest score will always be displayed on top of the screen untill exiting the game.
Highest score the author can achieve is 6950.
